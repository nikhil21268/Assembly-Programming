# Assembly Programming | Operating Systems Assignment
Created an assembly program in C, which takes user-input and prints out the result on the console.

# Problem Statement

## Assembly Program (Total Points: 25)

### Problem Overview
Develop a program in x86-64 assembly language, specifically in 64-bit mode, to accomplish the following tasks:
1. Accept a numerical input and a string input from the user via the console.
2. Display the entered number and string on the user's console.

### Requirements
1. **Input Handling:** Your program should successfully receive a numerical input and a string input from the user through the console.

2. **Output Display:** After taking inputs, the program must correctly print the entered number and string to the user's console.

### Submission Guidelines

#### What To Submit
1. **Source Code:** Provide a single assembly file with the extension .asm or .s that contains your program.

2. **Makefile:** Include a Makefile that facilitates the building of the assembly file into an executable.

#### Grading Rubric
- **Assembly Program (25 Points):**
  - **Program Building (4 Points):** Awarded for the successful compilation of the assembly program.
  - **scanf() Implementation (7 Points):** Awarded for the correct and functional use of scanf() to accept user inputs.
  - **printf() Implementation (7 Points):** Awarded for the correct and functional use of printf() to display the entered number and string.
  - **Program Execution (7 Points):** Awarded for the overall successful execution of the program.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure your assembly program adheres to the x86-64 architecture in 64-bit mode.
- Test your program thoroughly to guarantee correct functionality.
- Consider edge cases in user input to enhance the robustness of your program.
- Follow the provided grading rubric to maximize your score.
